Analyzing Manufacturing and Inventory Data
I worked on a project aimed at streamlining the manufacturing and inventory processes of an automobile company. The goal was to extract actionable insights from large datasets to improve operational efficiency and support informed decision-making. Using tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI, I handled raw manufacturing data, cleaned it for inconsistencies, and transformed it into meaningful insights.

For example, Python was utilized to preprocess the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and creating calculated fields. SQL was employed to query databases, perform complex joins, and extract the exact data points needed for analysis.

Developing a Star Schema Data Model
One of the major challenges was optimizing data for visualization while ensuring faster refresh rates. To address this, I designed a star schemaâ€”a popular data modeling technique. In this model:

Fact Table: Centralized metrics like production volume, inventory costs, and defect rates.
Dimension Tables: Categories like product type, manufacturing line, date, and supplier.
This structure reduced data redundancy, improved query performance, and ensured seamless integration with Power BI for real-time updates.

Interactive Dashboards and Custom KPIs
Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that gave stakeholders a clear, dynamic view of production metrics. These dashboards included:

Custom KPIs (Key Performance Indicators): Metrics like production yield, average downtime per manufacturing line, and inventory turnover rate.
Visualizations: Trendlines, bar charts, and heatmaps to showcase areas of inefficiency, production bottlenecks, and cost overruns.
Interactivity: Filters for users to explore data by product type, location, and time frame, making insights more accessible and actionable.
Identifying Cost-Saving Opportunities
Through detailed analysis, I uncovered inefficiencies such as overstocking of specific components and excessive downtime on certain production lines. For example:

Inventory Optimization: By comparing production schedules with inventory data, I identified items that could be ordered in smaller quantities, reducing holding costs.
Production Improvements: Insights into downtime reasons (e.g., maintenance delays or machine faults) helped prioritize corrective actions.
These findings were presented to management, accompanied by recommendations for improvement, leading to better resource allocation and cost savings.
